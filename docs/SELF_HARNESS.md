# Self-Harness

Self-Harness is FuguNano's net-new loop for improving the harness itself, not the
model. It is our abstraction of Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory's
paper "Self-Harness: Harnesses That Improve Themselves" (arXiv 2606.09498):
keep the model, evaluator, and benchmark fixed; mine verifier-grounded
weaknesses; ask a harness-backed agent for bounded edits to declared harness
surfaces; promote an edit only if it improves at least one fixed split without
regressing the other.

The implementation is split into pure domain logic, live adapters, and a CLI:

| Stage       | Port / adapter                   | Responsibility                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Mine     | `RunWeaknessMiner`               | Read failed `RunEvent`s, tag failures with model-backed signatures, cluster via the pure `clusterWeaknesses` function.   |
| 2. Propose  | `HarnessBackedProposer`          | Prompt a configured harness agent for strict JSON replacement edits, then parse and sanitize them.                       |
| 3. Validate | `TaskListHarnessValidator`       | Re-run fixed held-in and held-out cases (optionally `samples` times to denoise); a `verify` predicate decides pass/fail. |
| Accept      | `acceptEdit` / `SelfHarnessLoop` | Promote only if `deltaIn >= 0`, `deltaOut >= 0`, and at least one delta is positive.                                     |

## CLI

Generate a starter JSON spec:

```bash
orchestration/fuguectl/fuguectl self-harness template > /tmp/self-harness.json
```

Run the loop:

```bash
# The spec lives OUTSIDE --cwd. Keeping it in the workspace lets the scored
# candidate read every gate; the CLI refuses that arrangement.
orchestration/fuguectl/fuguectl self-harness run \
  --spec ~/.config/fugunano/self-harness.json \
  --state ~/.config/fugunano \
  --cwd /path/to/workspace
```

`--cwd` is **required**, and the spec must live **outside** it. Both the harness
dispatch and the `sh -c` gate run in `--cwd`, so anything reachable from there
is readable by the very agent being scored — and the spec carries every gate
string, i.e. every answer. The CLI resolves both paths with `realpath` and
refuses to run when the spec is inside the working directory.

This was measured, not assumed: a stub candidate that never performed the task
and only searched its working directory for gate material scored a perfect 2/2
on **both** the held-in and held-out splits. A candidate that reads the spec
games both splits equally, so held-out — whose whole purpose is to be
un-gameable — stops being evidence. Moving the spec out closed it completely
and left honest candidates unaffected. The flag was previously optional, and
omitting it made both the dispatch and the gate inherit the operator's shell
directory, which is where the old example put the spec: the leak was what
happened when the docs were followed.

Keep evaluator material — the spec, any answer key, fixture expectations — in a
directory the candidate is never spawned in.

## Spec Schema

The spec is strict JSON:

```json
{
  "agent": "cc-deepseek",
  "harness": "fugue-cc",
  "k": 2,
  "rounds": 1,
  "samples": 2,
  "runId": "source-run-id-mined-each-round",
  "config": {
    "system-prompt": "<system-prompt replacement text>",
    "memory-sources": "<memory-sources replacement text>",
    "subagents": "<subagents replacement text>",
    "skills": "<skills replacement text>",
    "bootstrap": "<bootstrap replacement text>",
    "execution": "<execution replacement text>",
    "verification": "<verification replacement text>",
    "failure-recovery": "<failure-recovery replacement text>",
    "runtime-policy": "<runtime-policy replacement text>"
  },
  "heldIn": [
    {
      "key": "held-in-example",
      "promptTemplate": "Use {{system-prompt}}\n\nTask: create /tmp/fugunano-self-harness-held-in",
      "gate": "test -f /tmp/fugunano-self-harness-held-in && rm -f /tmp/fugunano-self-harness-held-in"
    }
  ],
  "heldOut": [
    {
      "key": "held-out-example",
      "promptTemplate": "Use {{verification}}\n\nTask: create /tmp/fugunano-self-harness-held-out",
      "gate": "test -f /tmp/fugunano-self-harness-held-out && rm -f /tmp/fugunano-self-harness-held-out"
    }
  ]
}
```

Validation rules:

- `agent` and `runId` must be non-empty strings; identifier whitespace is
  trimmed during parsing.
- `harness`, if present, must be `fugue-cc`, `codex`, or `opencode`; when
  omitted, CLI wiring dispatches through `fugue-cc`.
- `k` and `rounds` must be positive integers.
- `samples` (optional, default `1`) is how many times each eval case is re-run
  per scoring. Pass counts and totals both scale by it, so the acceptance gate
  aggregates across repeats — raise it to denoise non-deterministic models (a
  single noisy sample can otherwise flip a split and reject a real improvement).
- `harnessArgs` (optional) is a string array spliced into every harness dispatch:
  e.g. `["-c", "mcp_servers={}"]` keeps `codex exec` from hanging on a host whose
  codex config points at a flaky remote MCP, and `["-s", "workspace-write"]` lets
  a codex agent write the files a gate checks.
- The top-level object is strict: unknown fields are rejected.
- `config` must contain exactly the editable surfaces declared by
  `EDITABLE_SURFACES`, all strings; unknown surfaces are rejected.
- `heldIn` and `heldOut` are arrays of `{ key, promptTemplate, gate }`; each
  object is strict, each field must be a non-empty string, and trimmed keys must
  be unique within a split. Empty splits are allowed, but they provide no useful
  validation signal.

## Prompt Rendering

Evaluation prompts use the normal `renderTemplate` substitution:

```text
{{system-prompt}} -> config["system-prompt"]
{{verification}}  -> config["verification"]
```

Unknown placeholders are left untouched. The validator dispatches the rendered
prompt to the configured harness/agent, then runs `sh -c <gate>`. A gate exit
code of `0` is a pass; dispatch errors and gate errors count as failures.
Prefer gates that clean up their own side effects, especially file-existence
checks, so one candidate cannot accidentally satisfy the next candidate's gate.

Treat a Self-Harness spec as trusted executable input: each `gate` runs through
`sh -c` in the selected working directory.

## Eval paths: tool-capable vs chat-only agents

The CLI's `verify` is a shell gate (`sh -c <gate>`), so it judges the _side
effects_ a dispatch produced — typically a file the agent was asked to create.
That requires a **tool-capable** agent:

- `fugue-cc` agents (Claude Code instances) edit files directly.
- `codex` needs `"harnessArgs": ["-s", "workspace-write"]` so `codex exec` may
  write inside the workspace.

A **chat-only** model (most `opencode run -m <provider/model>` targets) can still
mine and propose — both stages only need JSON back — but it cannot satisfy a
file-side-effect gate. To score a chat model, skip the CLI and construct
`TaskListHarnessValidator` directly with a `verify` that inspects
`DispatchResult.output` (the model's text) instead of a shell gate, e.g. a
deterministic format check; pair it with `samples > 1` to absorb model variance.
See `src/adapters/self-harness/self-harness-e2e.test.ts` for a wired example.

## Run Evidence

`runId` names the source run that Stage 1 mines. The CLI intentionally re-mines
the same run on every round:

```ts
(round) => spec.runId;
```

This is useful for "fixed-baseline" harness evolution where all candidate
configs are scored against the same weakness evidence and the same eval splits.
If you need fresh evidence between rounds, run the CLI again with a new source
run ID after executing the newly accepted harness.

Stage 1 reads only `RunEvent.kind` values `failed` and `no-agent`:

- `no-agent`: `detail = "<taskKey>"`
- `failed`: `detail = "<taskKey>: <reason>"`

Duplicate `taskKey`s are ignored after the first observation.

## Engineering Notes

- Expected failures never throw: harness dispatch errors, malformed model JSON,
  invalid proposal items, and gate failures are converted to empty results or
  failed cases.
- Model JSON is parsed through a shared balanced-array extractor that tolerates
  fenced output, prose around the payload, bracketed prose before the payload,
  and brackets inside JSON strings.
- Edits are full-surface replacements, not diffs. `applyEdit` replaces exactly
  one editable surface.
- The CLI prints one lineage row per candidate, then a compact per-surface
  `changed|same` summary and total promotions.

## Verification

Use the engine gates before relying on a change:

```bash
cd engine
npm run check
npm run build
../orchestration/fuguectl/fuguectl self-harness template

# Error-path smoke: should exit 1 and print "no self-harness spec at /tmp/nope".
# --cwd is required, so pass one even on the error path.
../orchestration/fuguectl/fuguectl self-harness run --spec /tmp/nope --cwd /tmp
```

A successful `run` smoke needs a real source `RunStore` record under
`--state/runs` plus a reachable harness/agent. In normal use, create or select a
completed run first, put its ID in `runId`, then run from the repo root:

```bash
# The spec lives OUTSIDE --cwd. Keeping it in the workspace lets the scored
# candidate read every gate; the CLI refuses that arrangement.
orchestration/fuguectl/fuguectl self-harness run \
  --spec ~/.config/fugunano/self-harness.json \
  --state ~/.config/fugunano \
  --cwd /path/to/workspace
```

The CLI unit suite also covers a no-weakness success path by writing a real
`FsRunStore` fixture and asserting the `changed|same` summary.
