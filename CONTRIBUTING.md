# Contributing

PRs welcome. This is a workflow repo that stitches together provider-backed model profiles + multi-Agent parallel dispatch orchestration + a review loop + auto-sync.

## Dev Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BicaMindLabs/FuguNano fugunano
cd fugunano

# Tools (for running the gates locally)
brew install gitleaks        # or apt
pipx install pre-commit && pre-commit install   # scans automatically on commit
```

## Gates (must pass before commit)

| Gate         | Command                | What it checks                                                                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Secrets      | `make scan`            | Plaintext key fingerprints + `provider.config*`'s `key=` must be a placeholder |
| Supply chain | `make check-workflows` | Every `uses:` in `.github/workflows/` is a full 40-hex commit SHA               |
| Scripts      | `make lint`            | Node launcher syntax + no checked-in `.sh` scripts                             |
| Docs         | `make check-docs`      | README/guide claims match the actual subcommands, counts and harness list      |
| Tests        | `make test`            | cn-plugin, scripts and fuguectl node tests                                     |
| All          | `make ci`              | The above run in sequence, plus the engine build and suite (= CI equivalent)   |

`make help` lists all targets. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the same gates, so if `make ci` is green locally, CI is basically green too.

## Hard Rules

- **Real keys never enter the repo.** See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). When editing `provider.config.example`, `key=` may only use `<...>` placeholders.
- **Launcher changes**: `backends/bin/*-code` stay as thin Node heads; shared logic goes into `cc-model-launcher.mjs`, don't copy it into each head. `make lint` must pass after editing.
- **Model upgrades**: edit `provider.config.example` + `cc-model-registry.tsv`, don't just change a string in the docs. Default/flagship profile changes must justify their reasoning in the PR (fit/cost need human judgment).
- **launcher runtime**: provider model tables and per-provider quirks live in `cc-model-launcher.mjs`; keep the entrypoint files tiny and executable.
- **Keep review independent**: second opinion/review goes through Codex or another configured independent backend. Antigravity (`agy`) can implement; legacy `gemini` CLI should not be reintroduced.

## Commit Conventions

- Use imperative + a type prefix: `feat:` / `fix:` / `chore:` / `docs:` / `perf:`.
- One thing per PR. For changes to `backends/` launcher logic, attach evidence that `make ci` passes.
- Add a line under the `Unreleased` section of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for user-facing changes.
